## Why `piggyback`?

`piggyback` grew out of the needs of students both in my classroom and in my research 
group, who frequently need to work with data files somewhat larger than one can 
conveniently manage by committing directly to GitHub.  As we frequently want to 
share and run code that depends on >50MB data files on each of our own machines, 
on continuous integration, and on larger computational servers, data sharing 
quickly becomes a bottleneck. 

[GitHub allows](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/distributing-large-binaries)
repositories to attach files of up to 2 GB each to releases as a way to distribute 
large files associated with the project source code.  There is no limit on the 
number of files or bandwidth to deliver them.  

## Authentication

No authentication is required to download data from *public* GitHub repositories 
using `piggyback`. Nevertheless, `piggyback` recommends setting a token when 
possible to avoid rate limits. To upload data to any repository, or to download 
data from *private* repositories, you will need to authenticate first. 

`piggyback` uses the same GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) that devtools, usethis, and
friends use (`gh::gh_token()`). The current best practice for managing your GitHub
credentials is detailed in this [usethis vignette](https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/git-credentials.html).

You can also add the token as an environment variable, which may be useful in 
situations where you use piggyback non-interactively (i.e.scheduled/automated scripts). 
Here are the relevant steps:

- Create a [GitHub Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo,gist&description=PIGGYBACK_PAT)
- Add the environment variable. You can do this:
  - via project-specific Renviron: `usethis::edit_r_environ("project")`. You should
  then add the Renviron to your gitignore via `usethis::use_git_ignore(".Renviron")`. 
  **Avoid committing your GITHUB_PAT to the repository for security reasons!**
  - via `Sys.setenv(GITHUB_PAT = "{your token}")` in your console for oneoff usage.
  Avoid adding this line to your R scripts -- remember, the goal here is to avoid 
  writing your private token in any file that might be shared, even privately.

## Downloading data

Download a file from a release:
```r
library(piggyback)
pb_download("iris2.tsv.gz", 
            repo = "cboettig/piggyback-tests",
            tag = "v0.0.1",
            dest = tempdir())
```
```
ℹ Downloading "iris2.tsv.gz"...
  |======================================================| 100%
```
```r
fs::dir_tree(tempdir())
```
```
/tmp/RtmpWxJSZj
└── iris2.tsv.gz
```

**Tips:**

1. Whenever you are working from a location inside a git repository corresponding 
to your GitHub repo, you can simply omit the `repo` argument and it will be detected 
automatically. 
2. Likewise, if you omit the release `tag`, `pb_download` will simply pull data 
from most recent release (`latest`).  
3. You can omit `tempdir()` if you are using an RStudio Project (`.Rproj` file) 
in your repository: download locations will be relative to Project root.  
`tempdir()` is used throughout the examples only to meet CRAN policies and is 
unlikely to be the choice you actually want here.  

4. Omit the file name to download all assets connected with a given release.  
```r
pb_download(repo = "cboettig/piggyback-tests",
            tag = "v0.0.1",
            dest = tempdir())
```
```
ℹ Downloading "diamonds.tsv.gz"...
  |======================================================| 100%
ℹ Downloading "iris.tsv.gz"...
  |======================================================| 100%
ℹ Downloading "iris.tsv.xz"...
  |======================================================| 100%
```
```r
fs::dir_tree(tempdir())
```
```
/tmp/RtmpWxJSZj
├── diamonds.tsv.gz
├── iris.tsv.gz
├── iris.tsv.xz
└── iris2.tsv.gz
```

These defaults mean that in most cases, it is sufficient to simply call `pb_download()` 
without additional arguments to pull in any data associated with a project on a 
GitHub repo that is too large to commit to git directly. 

Notice that above, `iris2.tsv.gz` was not downloaded. `pb_download()` will skip 
downloading of any file that already exists locally, if the timestamp on the local copy is more recent than the timestamp on the GitHub copy.  Use the `overwrite` parameter to control this behaviour.

`pb_download()` also includes arguments to control the progress bar or if any particular 
files should not be downloaded.  

### Download URLs

Sometimes it is preferable to have a URL from which the data can be read in directly, 
rather than downloading the data to a local file.  For example, such a URL can be 
embedded directly into another R script, avoiding any dependence on `piggyback` 
(provided the repository is already public.)  To get a list of URLs rather than 
actually downloading the files, use `pb_download_url()`:

```r
pb_download_url(repo = "cboettig/piggyback-tests",  
                tag = "v0.0.1")
```
```
[1] "https://github.com/cboettig/piggyback-tests/releases/download/v0.0.1/diamonds.tsv.gz"
[2] "https://github.com/cboettig/piggyback-tests/releases/download/v0.0.1/iris.tsv.gz"    
[3] "https://github.com/cboettig/piggyback-tests/releases/download/v0.0.1/iris.tsv.xz"    
[4] "https://github.com/cboettig/piggyback-tests/releases/download/v0.0.1/iris2.tsv.gz" 
```

## Uploading data

If your GitHub repository doesn't have any 
[releases](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-releases-in-a-repository) 
yet, `piggyback` will help you quickly create one.  Create new releases to manage 
multiple versions of a given data file, or to organize sets of files. 

While you can create releases as often as you like, making a new release is not 
necessary each time you upload a file.  If maintaining old versions of the data 
is not useful, you can stick with a single release and upload all of your data 
there.  

```r
pb_release_create(repo = "cboettig/piggyback-tests", tag = "v0.0.2")
```
```
✔ Created new release "v0.0.2".
```

Once we have at least one release available, we are ready to upload.  By default, 
`pb_upload` will attach data to the latest release.  

```r
## We'll need some example data first.
## Pro tip: compress your tabular data to save space & speed upload/downloads
readr::write_tsv(mtcars, "mtcars.tsv.gz")

pb_upload("mtcars.tsv.gz", 
          repo = "cboettig/piggyback-tests")
```
```
ℹ Uploading to latest release: "v0.0.2".
ℹ Uploading mtcars.tsv.gz ...
  |===================================================| 100%
```

Like `pb_download()`, `pb_upload()` will overwrite any file of the same name already 
attached to the release file by default, unless the timestamp of the previously 
uploaded version is more recent.  You can toggle these settings with the `overwrite`
parameter.

### Multiple files

You can pass in a vector of file paths with something like `list.files()` to the `file` argument of `pb_upload()` in order to upload multiple files. Some common patterns: 

```r
library(magrittr)

## upload a folder of data
list.files("data") %>% 
  pb_upload(repo = "cboettig/piggyback-tests", tag = "v0.0.1")

## upload certain file extensions
list.files(pattern = c("*.tsv.gz", "*.tif", "*.zip")) %>% 
  pb_upload(repo = "cboettig/piggyback-tests", tag = "v0.0.1")

```
Similarly, you can download all current data assets of the latest or specified 
release by using `pb_download()` with no arguments.

## Deleting Files

Delete a file from a release:

```r
pb_delete(file = "mtcars.tsv.gz", 
          repo = "cboettig/piggyback-tests", 
          tag = "v0.0.1")
```
```
ℹ Deleted "mtcars.tsv.gz" from "v0.0.1" release on "cboettig/piggyback-tests"
```
Note that this is irreversible unless you have a copy of the data elsewhere. 

## Listing Files

List all files currently piggybacking on a given release.  Omit `tag` to see 
files on all releases.  

```r
pb_list(repo = "cboettig/piggyback-tests", 
        tag = "v0.0.1")
```
```
        file_name   size           timestamp    tag    owner            repo
1 diamonds.tsv.gz 571664 2021-09-07 23:38:31 v0.0.1 cboettig piggyback-tests
2     iris.tsv.gz    846 2021-08-05 20:00:09 v0.0.1 cboettig piggyback-tests
3     iris.tsv.xz    848 2020-03-07 06:18:32 v0.0.1 cboettig piggyback-tests
4    iris2.tsv.gz    846 2018-10-05 17:04:33 v0.0.1 cboettig piggyback-tests
```

## Caching

To reduce GitHub API calls, piggyback caches `pb_releases` and `pb_list` with a 
timeout of 10 minutes by default.  This avoids repeating identical requests to 
update its internal record of the repository data (releases, assets, timestamps, etc) 
during programmatic use.  You can increase or decrease this delay by setting the 
environment variable in seconds, e.g. `Sys.setenv("piggyback_cache_duration" = 10)` 
for a longer delay or `Sys.setenv("piggyback_cache_duration" = 0)` to disable caching, 
and then restarting R.

## Valid file names

GitHub assets attached to a release do not support file paths, and will convert 
most special characters (`#`, `%`, etc) to `.` or throw an error (e.g. for file 
names containing `$`, `@`, `/`). `piggyback` will default to using the base name of 
the file only (i.e. will only use `"mtcars.csv"` if provided a file path like 
`"data/mtcars.csv"`)

## A Note on GitHub Releases vs Data Archiving

`piggyback` is not intended as a data archiving solution.  Importantly, bear in 
mind that there is nothing special about multiple "versions" in releases, as far 
as data assets uploaded by `piggyback` are concerned.  The data files `piggyback` 
attaches to a Release can be deleted or modified at any time -- creating a new 
release to store data assets is the functional equivalent of just creating new 
directories `v0.1`, `v0.2` to store your data.  (GitHub Releases are always pinned 
to a particular `git` tag, so the code/git-managed contents associated with repo 
are more immutable, but remember our data assets just piggyback on top of the repo).  

Permanent, published data should always be archived in a proper data repository 
with a DOI, such as [zenodo.org](https://zenodo.org). Zenodo can freely archive 
public research data files up to 50 GB in size, and data is strictly versioned 
(once released, a DOI always refers to the same version of the data, new releases 
are given new DOIs). `piggyback` is meant only to lower the friction of working 
with data during the research process, (e.g. provide data accessible to collaborators 
or continuous integration systems during research process, including for private 
repositories.)

## What will GitHub think of this?

[GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/distributing-large-binaries) at the time of writing endorses the use of attachments to releases as a 
solution for distributing large files as part of your project:
